Description: Utilize the power of genetic algorithms to enhance clustering performance in scenarios where clusters play a pivotal role in correlation calculations. Employ a genetic algorithm with a fitness function centered around correlation to optimize clustering outcomes, ultimately maximizing correlation values. This package finds frequent application in the realm of gene expression data analysis.
